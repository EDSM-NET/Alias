They are good thermal insulators, and have a high melting point, but if they are melted they lose all their special properties and become a conventional alloy. They are easily machined, but as yet cannot be manufactured and are only found in space. They are associated with recently discovered alien entities nicknamed \'Large Barnacles\' by interstellar explorers.
